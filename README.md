# 07--2D-Platformer
A simply 2D Platformer game created for MSCH-G220 Game Technology class. Enjoy!

You play as a slime on an adventure through some twisted caves filled with hoards of glittering treasure but evil slimes and spooky ghosts threaten you! You're too weak to damage them, but they most certainly can squish you if they catch you!

There is not a save/load functionality to this game, but there is a retry if you die on a level.
Sprites by yours truly, Emily Clinkscales!
